# Open Budget Sites

This copies the project of the the [City of Philadelphiaâ€™s Office of Innovation and Technology](http://www.phila.gov/data/), based on a project by [OpenData.ch](https://github.com/tpreusse/open-budget), the Swiss division of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/).

The desire is to have the ability to have a tool to generate budgets across different cities or agencies.
